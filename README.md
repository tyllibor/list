  first)

  from 1)
- Each item should keep track of when the item was added
- Search bar should have multiple functionality
  - Non-empty value can be cleared through the clear button, or by pressing
    Escape key
  - If searched string (case insensitive) is already present in the list, the
    add button is disabled and appropriate item is marked as "Exact match"
  - If no exact match is found, the add button is enabled and click on it or
    press of Enter key should add the string to the list
- Search bar, list item and icons (svg files in assets) should be individual
  components
